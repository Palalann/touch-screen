# Code use for touch screen 
Base on 9618 w21 qp 21, question 6

A mobile phone has a touchscreen. The screen is represented by a grid, divided into 800 rows
and 1280 columns.
The grid is represented by a 2D array Screen of type INTEGER. An array element will be set to 0
unless the user touches that part of the screen.
Many array elements are set to 1 by a single touch of a finger or a stylus.
The following diagram shows a simplified touchscreen. The dark line represents a touch to the
screen. All grid elements that are wholly or partly inside the outline will be set to 1. These elements
are shaded.
The element shaded in black represents the centre point.

Assume:

• the user may only touch one area at a time

• screen rotation does not affect the touchscreen.

The code is written to declare any neccessary fuction and procedure use to find the coordinate of centre point in Python. For example, the coordinate of centre point in the image above is 6, 11.
